### Overview
#### The New York citi-bike helped to get to the know the city and its people who are using bikes for their commutes. This analysis uses the New York citi-bike data to help us decide if the bike-share company idea could work in Des Moines.

### Data Cleaning
#### As a first step, we are using Python and Pandas functions, to convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After we converted the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, we exported the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.


### We created visualizations using Tableau worksheets that show:

#### - How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
#### - How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
#### - A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.


### Key Findings:
#### - The gender that rents the most number of bikes in the New York citi-bike analysis are males.
#### - Males who are the highest bike renters, are mostly subcribers than customers. So maybe they are using it for work during the weekdays.
#### - Also, the busiest times during the weekdays were, Monday through Friday at 8AM and then around 5PM and 6PM. Which tells us that the bikes were primarily used as commute during work/week days.

#### We then created a new Story using visualizations from the Tableau worksheet that will support the key findings.
